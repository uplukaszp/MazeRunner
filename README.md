# MazeRunner

My implementation of [Maze generation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Depth-first_search) and [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm). The Genetic Algorithm is used for finding the best path from top left  to the bottom right corner of the labirynth.
